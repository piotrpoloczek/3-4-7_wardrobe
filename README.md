Clothes
Implement different clothes that can be placed on hangers.

All clothes have a unique identifier (UUID) field named id, which is set when created. The identifier cannot be changed later. It is available through the UUID getId() method.

All clothes have a brandName field which can be set only once at creation. Its value is returned when calling the getBrandName method.

All clothes have a type field, which is different for different kinds of clothing. The type can be one from the following list.

shirt
blouse
trousers
skirt
There is a special type of clothing named UpperClothes. Its type can be only shirt or blouse. Otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

There is a special type of clothing named LowerClothes. Its type can be only trousers or skirt. Otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.



Hangers
Implement different types of hangers which can store different clothes in different ways.

Every Hanger has the following capabilities.

Optional<Clothes> @takeOff() returns a clothing item currently stored on hanger.
Optional<Clothes> @takeOff(UUID id) returns the requested clothing item by ID. If the clothing item is not on the hanger, it returns empty.
void @put(Clothes clothes) puts the clothing item on the hanger if there is a free slot. Otherwise, it throws an IllegalStateException.
boolean @hasSlotFor(ClothesType type) determines whether there is a free slot for a particular ClothesType.
The ShirtHanger can only accommodate clothes that can be worn on the upper body (shirts and blouses). As a ShirtHanger can accommodate only one clothing item, the value of the hasSlotFor method is only true when the hanger does not store any clothes. The currently stored clothing item can be taken off by hanger or by its ID.

The PantHanger can accommodate one shirt or blouse and one skirt or pair of trousers. Based on the @put(Clothes clothes) parameter runtime type, it the clothes are automatically moved to the proper slot. If there is no place for the particular type, an IllegalStateException is thrown.

The hasSlotFor method returns true if the hanger has a free slot for the requested clothing type.

Upper and lower body clothing items can be taken off one-by-one from a PantHanger using the Optional<Clothes> @takeOff() method. This method always returns the upper body clothes first, when possible. Lower body clothing items are only returned when no upper body items are stored on the hanger.

Wardrobe
The wardrobe stores the clothes, but there are some rules on how clothes can be placed in it.

A Wardrobe can only accommodate a certain number of hangers, based on the value of the limit field. The value of limit can vary between different wardrobes. The value of limit is defined when creating the wardrobe and cannot be changed afterwards. The value of limit can be queried at any time using @getLimit() method. The value of limit cannot exceed 120. When trying to create a Wardrobe with a limit over 120, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a 'Maximum limit is 120.' message.

There is a @put(Hanger hanger) method that enables placing a hanger in the wardrobe. If there is free space in wardrobe, the hanger is stored.

No more hangers can be placed in the wardrobe than physically possible. When trying to place a hanger in the wardrobe and the wardrobe is full, an IllegalStateException is thrown with a 'The wardrobe currently is full.' message.

Empty hangers can be placed into the wardrobe by calling put(Hanger hanger).

There is a count() method which returns the number hangers in the wardrobe.

Hangers with clothes on them can be placed in wardrobe by calling put(Hanger hanger).

A clothing item can only be hung in the wardrobe if it is placed on a hanger.

You can get an empty hanger using the Hanger getHanger(ClothesType type) method. It returns an available hanger. If no free hanger is available, a NoSuchElementException is thrown with a 'No empty hangers for your clothes' message.

Clothes can be taken out of the wardrobe based on their unique identifier by calling the Clothes @getClothes(UUID id) method. If the clothing item is not in the wardrobe, a NoSuchElementException is thrown with a 'Clothes not found.' message.
